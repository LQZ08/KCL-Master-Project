# **Supervision Diary**

## **Meeting date**

27/1/2023

## **Plan your targets and next steps**

### Targets 
1. Focus on project proposal.
2. Write proposal draft before next meeting. 
3. Background reading.


### Actions Taken
1. Read papers about NER and RE.
2. Write introduction part of the proposal.


### What academic reading have you done?
End-to-End Relation Extraction using LSTMs on Sequences and Tree Structures
Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction: State-of-the-Art
The Survey of Joint Entity and Relation Extraction
LSTM Neural Networks for Language Modeling

### Summary of content
Different neural network models that can be used in the NER and RE model building process.

### Training Focus
Get to understand the methedology part of the project including unknown topics and techniques will be used in future model building process.
Write project proposal.

## **What progress have you made in addressing key issues?  What are your key issues for futher development? What are your next targets/tasks?**

### **Evaluation and Review of Targets**
After more readings on the related contents, have a more clear understanding about what techniques can be used in the model building process. LSTM will be the main focus in the future study.


### **Achievements and issues for development**
Random Forest, SVM and LSTM methods are still require more understanding.


### **Comments from Supervisor**
