    abstract="In general, people use the pipeline method for named entity recognition and relationship extraction, which, though, cannot take full advantage of the benefits in between. To solve this problem, people turned their attention to the method of joint entity and relation extraction. This review surveys several ways in joint entity and relation extraction based neural networks. It systematically summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the models. After comparing these models' performance of various datasets, this paper found that the model using BERT achieve the state-of-the-art result. The reasons and possible future development directions are analyzed and discussed.",

    abstract = "{This article summarizes the preparation, organization, evaluation, and results of Track 2 of the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges shared task. Track 2 focused on extraction of adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical records and evaluated 3 tasks: concept extraction, relation classification, and end-to-end systems. We perform an analysis of the results to identify the state of the art in these tasks, learn from it, and build on it.For all tasks, teams were given raw text of narrative discharge summaries, and in all the tasks, participants proposed deep learningâ€“based methods with hand-designed features. In the concept extraction task, participants used sequence labelling models (bidirectional long short-term memory being the most popular), whereas in the relation classification task, they also experimented with instance-based classifiers (namely support vector machines and rules). Ensemble methods were also popular.A total of 28 teams participated in task 1, with 21 teams in tasks 2 and 3. The best performing systems set a high performance bar with F1 scores of 0.9418 for concept extraction, 0.9630 for relation classification, and 0.8905 for end-to-end. However, the results were much lower for concepts and relations of Reasons and ADEs. These were often missed because local context is insufficient to identify them.This challenge shows that clinical concept extraction and relation classification systems have a high performance for many concept types, but significant improvement is still required for ADEs and Reasons. Incorporating the larger context or outside knowledge will likely improve the performance of future systems.}",
